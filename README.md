# word2vec

word2vec exercise Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai.  

## cosine_similarity
Takes two word2vec representations and calculates their cosine similarity

## Complete_analogy
Takes three words - word_a, word_b, word_c  
Finds a word - word_d, such that  
the relationship word_a TO word_b IS word_d to word_c.  
E.G:  
word_a - Oslo  
word_b - Norway  
word_c - New Zealand  
word_d should be Wellington
